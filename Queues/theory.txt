By default priorityQueue is a Min-Heap . 
So when you peek the element i.e with highest priority it return you the minimum value
To create a Max - Heap use a Custom comparator like in second java file

##        K-th largest element in Stream 

This problem is a priority (heap) question where we maintain a DS that can efficiently return the K-th largest element at any point

##          priority Queue with Custom Objects
imagine you need to schedule tasks based on priority
