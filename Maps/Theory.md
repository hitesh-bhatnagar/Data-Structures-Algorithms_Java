# When and where to use Maps

* Count frequencies
  * how many times each word or character appears

* Group Items
  * Grouping items by a common property (like grouping anagrams together)

* Fast Lookup
  * Quickly check if an element exists or retrive an associated value

* Maintain Relationships
  * Associate keys and values -- for instance, student IDs to names.

* Perform Aggregation
  * Sum values by key or merge information from different sources
